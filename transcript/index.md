# When Houdini met Goldblum

## Intro

This is my story of learning Houdini and how I was introduced to it by Jeff Goldblum. 

In it I'll talk about what Houdini is, how its component parts relate to each other and how you can start your own journey.

## Definition: "What even is Houdini"

> Houdini future-proofs styling

Let's start with the term "Houdini". Here's the definition Mozilla gives:

> CSS Houdini is a W3C effort to define lower-level CSS DOM APIs for authors to understand, recreate, and extend high-level CSS authoring features.

This is the Extensible Web Manifesto for CSS: we, as developers, are being given the tools we need to take styling in any direction we want to go. 

To use Surma's example, imagine you want conic gradients: Houdini provides the Paint API to let you define the behaviour of that feature in JavaScript and have it run at native speed in the browser.

Just like in HTML, the solutions that emerge from iterating on and refining the features our community actually uses 

> [Houdini] provides new low-level capabilities that expose the possibilities of the underlying platform as closely as possible. [It] seeds the discussion of high-level APIs through JavaScript implementations of new features. This involves web developers in the process and by iterating outside of the browser, avoids the platform getting stuck with bad APIs.
